# CodePenChallenge: Cicada Principle

To quote from the CodePen website,

"The Cicada Principle in web design is inspired by how cicada bugs live in prime
number cycles. They go underground for 7, 13, or even 17 years at a time,
creating an illusion of randomness in when they appear. This same pseudo-
randomness can bring an organic, appealing vibe to front-end design.

This week's challenge template includes a grid of squares with background colors set
using the cicada principle and the nth-child pseudo-class. As always, the template
is just a starting point."
